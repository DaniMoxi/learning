### 1. Landing Page Design
A simple landing page for a product. Sort of a refresher on CSS & HTML.
### 2. Responsive Tableless Calendar
A responsive calendar styled completely in CSS, without using tables.
### 3. Pure CSS Image Slider
### 4. Transition Dropdown Menu
*Currenty bugged* - A dropdown menu written completely in CSS, with one small jQuery trick. The responsive-ness is bugged though.
### 5. CSS Timeline
*Only slightly bugged* - A CSS design for a timeline, which could also be used for photos or a resume/portfolio. There's a slight positioning bug at smaller-sized screens, so it's not completely responsive yet.
