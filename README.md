This is where I'll be putting any small projects of mine during my web development learning journey. These projects are being done in addition to working on (FreeCodeCamp)[]'s free fullstack curriculum. You can check my FreeCodeCamp progress (here)[]. 

**Projects in HTML5 -** This online course has 10 projects to practice the main frontend skills of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You can find more information over on (Stackskills)[stackskills.com/courses/projects-in-html5].
