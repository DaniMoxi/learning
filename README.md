This is where I'll be putting any small projects of mine during my web development learning journey. These projects are being done in addition to working on (FreeCodeCamp)[www.freecodecamp.com]'s free fullstack curriculum. 

**FreeCodeCamp -** FreeCodeCamp is an excellent fullstack web development curriculum teaching the MEAN development stack. The last phase of the curriculum involves creating real web applications for nonprofits, which is great practical experience before getting a job. You can check my FreeCodeCamp progress (here)[http://www.freecodecamp.com/danimoxi]. 

**Projects in HTML5 -** This online course has 10 projects to practice the main frontend skills of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You can find more information over on (Stackskills)[stackskills.com/courses/projects-in-html5].

**Projects in CSS3 -** This (course)[stackskills.com/courses/projects-in-css] has 10 projects focusing on CSS styling while also introducing CSS3's new animations feature and CSS preprocessors LESS and SASS.
